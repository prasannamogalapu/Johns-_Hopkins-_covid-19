# Johns-_Hopkins-_covid-19
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using the publicly available dataset provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).

#Overview
The objective of this project is to explore, clean, and analyze global COVID-19 data to uncover meaningful insights and visualize the spread of the virus over time. The dataset includes daily reports of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across various countries and regions.

Key highlights of the project:

Data sourced from the JHU CSSE COVID-19 GitHub Repository

Performed data wrangling and transformation using Pandas

Time-series analysis of confirmed, recovered, and death cases

Interactive visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

Country-wise comparison and growth rate analysis

Identification of peak case periods and trend forecasting (optional)

This project showcases my data science workflow, from data acquisition and cleaning to insightful analysis and visualization.
